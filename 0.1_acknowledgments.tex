First of all, a special acknowledgement to my parents for supporting me on these crazy choices of always going abroad to experience new cultures and methods of study and work, for showing me the right way to follow and for teaching me how not to lose hope and always fight for what I want.

To Samuel Frade, my co-advisor, for all the patience to introduce me to the openEHR world in a detailed way and giving me the idea of this dissertation theme to work in. And for answering my never-ending calls asking for help with Marand tools. And for all the guidance, support and commitment provided on this work. 

To Tina Vavpotic for the constant trust, support, listening, eternal patience and resilience during all the year not letting me give up. Sometimes living alone in another country can be hard. And also, for the chance to work on Pathfinder.  

To Leandro Gomes, also for the patience and willingness for teaching me how to solve the various bugs that appeared on my script (on a Slovenian keyboard without some special characters, which made this task 10 times worse), since programming on web development with languages like Angular was pretty new for me.

To Ales Cerne and Marko Pipan for the really useful advice and insight about openEHR resources and for teaching me how to deal internally with ADL Designer. To Metod Ribic and Marcel Salej for, once again, helping me to deal with some issues in the script.

To my advisor, Ricardo Correia for the encouragement, advices and support for me to go abroad and learning more about medical informatics in a practical way.


To all the people that work at Think!Registry at Marand, I have learned a lot with all of you.

To Cristina Castro Ribeiro, ECIM course director, for the trust, introduction on the Erasmus programme, advices and concern during all this six years of academic life. 

And at last, but not least, to all the ECIM praxis group at ISEP for the friendship, for showing me the values of a group that fights for a reason and for giving me the best moments of my academic life. And for always having the “arms wide open” ready for a welcoming huge hug every time I was going back to Portugal. 

A big, big thank you to all. Without all of you this would not be possible.
