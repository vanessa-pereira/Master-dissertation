Nowadays, it is almost impossible for the population to imagining themselves without any technology to help on daily basics or even to take care of their health. Since an early age, I had a huge interest in the electronic mechanisms in the medical area, mainly because these were so important to support my own life when I was a newborn. With that, I decided to do a licentiate degree in \ac{ECIM} at \ac{ISEP}. The interest in the information technology associated to the medical field started to appear from the previous course and in year of 2017 I decided to start my master studies in the \ac{MIM} at \ac{FMUP} and \ac{FCUP}. Also, I had the opportunity to work as junior student researcher in \ac{CINTESIS} and at Healthy Systems, a spin-off company from University of Porto focused on cybersecurity and performance consulting in healthcare systems. From there, I developed an interest in the standards of medical data and interoperability of different systems, mostly due to the opportunity of checking how it works in the real-world during the professional experience.\\ 

As a user with slightly preference on free open-source systems, I always had the idea that information and technology should be free to everyone. Once I had the chance to listen a presentation about openEHR and the curiosity on this topic increasing even more. With this, I planned to do a future study in this area and learn more about it. After some research on the actual market, I decided that the most advantageous option was to do again a mobility programme, now in the master degree under \textit{Erasmus + internship}. After applied, there was the possibility of making the dissertation at Marand d.o.o., a healthcare IT company located in Ljubljana, Slovenia, that most makes use OpenEHR standard on their electronic health record system (EHR). Along the academic year of 2017/2018, I had been working as a functional analyst for one of the projects inside of Marand, the Advanced Congestive Heart Failure (ACHF) where I have been performed as a functional analyst, openEHR modeler, terminologies definer and functional tester for portal of the project. \par
